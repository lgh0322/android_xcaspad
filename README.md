Android Xcas Pad
================

Xcas Pad computer algebra system source code project for Android

As maths kernel, Xcas Pad embed a port of the Giac/Xcas library.
Giac/Xcas library is a powerful maths kernel used by many platforms, like the Hewlett Packard HP Prime calculator. 
Also users of the Texas Instruments calculators(TI89, Voyage 200, TI Nspire) could find very familiar the CAS.

Despite Xcas Pad is released here, still is conceptual and it means to many things could be changed and is in 
continuous development, so keep in mind the future releases could have new and better features.

Xcas Pad uses MathJax as frontend TeX render. 

Feel free to copy, modify and distribute this source code files in order to contribute to the improvement of this work.
There is no commercial purpose for this front end it's just an enthusiasm attempt to achieve a free calculous system.

So any contribution to the Android front end are welcome.

Thanks to Bernard Parisse for write and share the Giac library.
